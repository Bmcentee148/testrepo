    <h1> Test Heading <h1>

    <p>This is a test paragraph. It will be used to see if we can revert
    some changed we previously made to a single file, without altering the 
    subsequent changes. We'll see how it goes. || This change was made after
    changes made on macbook but before merging those into the local repo. ||</p>
    

    <h2> Test Heading Number 2 <h2>

    <p> This crap should stay here when I revert the commit before it. That is,
    the text above is the only thing that should be removed. We shall see though,
    I think I've done this before and didn't achieve the expected results.</p>

    <h2>Test Heading Number 3(Mac Edit)</h2>
    <p>This was another paragraph but from the Mac.</p>
